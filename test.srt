1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,912
You're only half right

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
You can see whole Nations

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:17,920
How to blanch it was just a few like we had never had before and I think my words of that time we review

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Beautiful view

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
Which it certainly was

6
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,192
I want to cross the Atlantic going into the dark side

7
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,568
Then when I was coming out on the light side of the Earth again with the first rays of the sun coming

8
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,152
Coming through the Earth's atmosphere and to the spacecraft

9
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
The glass out the window it look like

10
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,344
Look like a summer evening out in the meadow some place where there are a few fireflies but there were millions of

11
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
As far as I could see

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Wallflower of them coming but another graveyard really determined later on was it

13
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Moisture particles

14
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,960
From the heat exchanger was a little drip of water comes out that then diffused into

15
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,800
Much smaller particles all over it

16
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
You're one of the few people who has been portrayed

17
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
During his lifetime in film

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
How do you think Ed Harris

19
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Never met and he rose to this day

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
That way

21
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,392
People think we had something to do with it movie The Right Stuff and we didn't

22
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
Had no connection with them at all

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
When Hollywood got hold of that film is a sort of

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Need free Fantasy 4

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
All is well stations

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
People that very often what's the most memorable

27
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Event your life and I'll expect those space

28
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
Light of course and that is a big one

29
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
But I don't think anything ever surpasses what you doing come back

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
Those are some vivid things that are impressed on your memory

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,608
And I'm sure every veteran has been in combat would agree with that there's nothing compares to that

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
31 of my check out missions when I was flying waiting on there yet

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Squadron Co we were down low and he got hit by any aircraft fire

34
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
Control airplane had to get out

35
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
It went down on the ground and

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Scrub

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Brush area and I saw the parachute being pulled in after he went down there and this is way up a couple of them

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Mother behind the line

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
I calculated the amount of fuel I would need

40
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
To get back to altitude again enough to

41
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Flying back over our own lines

42
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,448
Because I really thought we were just within minutes of ever getting him out of there

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,848
But I was down low and kept circling and circling and circling in the chopper never did get there in time so

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
When I get my minimum fuel enough to get me back to 40000 feet

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
Flamed out up there and glided back over our lines will

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
A good Tailwind at altitude that day and so I got back over our base

47
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
What would have happened was his little Danny

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Blowing up and make a big

49
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Sizzling noise

50
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
Insulating people in the soldier knew where to come

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
They were they got him and wash him off and leave

52
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Later on he came out as a PW in the end of what was called Big switch on the prisoner exchange at the end of that

53
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Time.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
And I was able to be up there

55
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Berated me and either way you love me forever to try to get you he said everytime you come around up there

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
Yeah they would throw me in a ditch and sit on me or step on me

57
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Stand on me

58
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
And it really hurt my shoulder cuz he's already been shot

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
You only wanted me to do is just go away and go home

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Guitar Center Glen

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
Let me ask you something is there anybody watching and you would like to take out the

62
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
In space with you and just

63
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Leave there

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
Remind me to come up and help us understand if they want to come up here they wouldn't provide the money to bring me back so I'm glad

65
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,856
Are the reason I was up there as a matter of fact on the second flight wasn't just a final assignment

66
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
I had noted in some of the NASA

67
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Material

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,303
That there were some 52 changes in the human body that occur in space

69
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
And over period of time

70
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703
The Earth here the human body changes as you get older

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
There about 8 or 10 of those things like

72
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
The body's immune system you you get less resistant to disease infection of the error period of time the same thing

73
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
To the elderly right here on Earth

74
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
It might make it possible for the younger people to stay up in flight

75
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Much longer without harmful effect that might even

76
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,231
Give us some clues of how we take away the frailties of old age right here on Earth

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,791
And then I volunteered for the flight and

78
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,679
Was told that I have to pass the same physical as everybody else oh and I was able to do that so

79
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
I felt the great Fortune to be up there with

80
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
4 days up there that I had that 21 different parameters were being recorded in and blood samples each day that I was

81
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Was on that routine also

82
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
I understand you had a nickname

83
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Don't know what that was

84
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,647
Well he told me that you called him Count Dracula

85
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
Scott became Dracula the movie as far as I was concerned we got the blood and that was all

86
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
That was the objective

87
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,703
That you grew up in a pretty small town in Ohio you grew up in New Concord

88
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
That's where you met and your wife could you just talk about

89
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
The experience of growing up in

90
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Small town in America and what that did

91
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
For you

92
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
I think that there couldn't be a better place to grow up

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
Children watch for free

94
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,623
To do what they want to do and for more kids groups and go camping in

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,207
Swimming in the in the creek down the pull of the town

96
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Who's the depth of the Great Depression

97
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
People would come up to our home from Old Route 40 the National Road

98
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
And knock on the front door and ask mother if she could spare him something to eat

99
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,567
A mother would always making a plate of food and I sit on the back steps needed

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
We planted a huge Garden

101
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,503
Another candle out of stuff in the end that became something it wasn't that we share with other people in town

102
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
I'm sure that those experiences in life everyday

103
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
The Concorde video

104
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Affected my life

105
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
If you don't mind my asking how would you like to be remembered

106
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
I'm not interested in sitting looking back at legacies all the time I told someone too short time ago as far as the Legacy goes

107
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
I'll leave it up to what other people

108
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
Dean was important
